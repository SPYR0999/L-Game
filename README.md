# LGame

Developed with Unreal Engine 4

Here is the Trello page of the project so you'll can keep track of what's been done, what we are currently working on and what we will do in the future.

This is more of a test than a commercial game so it may not be released to the public. However, if it turns out good enough, it probably will.

The game is currently not planned to have any AI or Online features and only a two-player mode will be available. Maybe if the interest is large enough, those features could be added but would require either an update, or a full reinstall of te game, as well as more development time.

If you have any suggestions for the project, please let us know in the comments section.
I would ask you not to comment the [dev chat] node inside overview because it is restricted to developers.
Feel free to comment everything else.

Thank you,

The Linear Planet team.
