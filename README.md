# L-Game

Developed with Unreal Engine 4

Click [here](https://trello.com/b/q9FFuew6) to open the Trello page of the project so you'll can keep track of what's been done, what we are currently working on and what we will do in the future.

Click [here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/i2u745no5g563vj/L-Game.zip/file) to open the MediaFire link for the latest compiled version of the game. Not everything might be stable but major concepts should be. We would appreciate if you share bugs you find in the comments section of the Trello or on GitHub within the issues section. Thank you.

This is more of a test than a commercial game so it may not be released to the public. However, if it turns out good enough, it probably will.

The game is currently not planned to have any AI or Online features and only a local two-player mode will be available. Maybe if the interest is large enough, those features could be added but would require either an update, or a full reinstall of te game, as well as more development time.

If you have any suggestions for the project, please let us know in the comments section.
I would ask you not to comment the [dev chat] node inside overview because it is restricted to developers.
Feel free to comment everything else.

Thank you,

The Linear Planet team.
